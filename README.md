## üåä What is LaVague?

The LaVague VSCode extension is an **open-source** project designed to automate automation for devs! 

It enables you to leverage AI to turn your **natural language instructions** into Python code for automation leveraging **Selenium**.

Behind the scenes, we use **advanced AI techniques** (RAG, Few-shot learning, Chain of Thought) to enhance performance - check out [our documentation to find out more](https://docs.lavague.ai/en/latest/)!

> Note you will need to have an OpenAI API key set in your notebook environment. If you don't have yours set in this environment, you can add the following code into a cell:

  ```
  import os
  os.environ['OPENAI_API_Key'] = ''
  ```

Your automation code will populate the next cell.
